#Hone and Align Relevant Skills

Prior to conceptualizing your new website, it is important to first audit your relevant prerequisite skills — namely, those rooted in web development and coding. Such skills can be instrumental in DIY site creation, as they can help you handle crucial technical phases autonomously which may allow for a smoother development process and easier creative control.
Helpful website development prerequisites may include coding in languages like JavaScript and HTML/CSS (for various design and usability factors)

# Choose a Hosting Provider
Choosing a hosting provider is a relatively easy, but crucial part of website creation. Many leading hosting platforms (such as niagahoster ) have expedited this process, often providing complimentary domain registration, discounted website building tools and other perks for first-time registrations.

As in the previous step, this decision should be rooted in your needs and goals for the site — especially those related to site structure and usability. For example, if the site is intended to showcase image galleries and multimedia, you will likely want to pick a platform allowing space for larger files and adequate speed. Using such criteria, you’ll be able to narrow your options down to a few promising providers and determine which will be the most cost-effective, reliable and in tune with your company’s aspirations.

# 4. Choose a Domain Name
Selecting a website domain name may be quick and simple in theory, but as GoDaddy notes, the choice is comparable to that of a company name. It can require quite a bit of thought and consideration, as your domain name will play a large part in your online identity.
